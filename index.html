        I've always loved fitness and strengthening my body. Right now I've
        started training in calisthenics since lockdown has closed all gyms for
        the past 2 years. Calisthenics is essentially bodyweight training. It
        sounds simple but there are many cool calisthenics moves. For example,
        the planche is a technique that I want to learn.

        Im currently learning about investing in the stock market. I've read a
        book called "One Up on Wall Street" by Peter Lynch and I'm currently
        reading "Invested" by Danielle Town. The goal is to invest like Warren
        Buffet himself!
